It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.

Thank you very much everybody.
